## 🧠 Background & History

The **Centralized Docs System (CDS)** was developed to address a major inefficiency in many QA teams: scattered documentation, manual reporting overhead, and lack of real-time visibility into team progress.  

Before CDS, test cases, bug reports, task tracking, and sprint outputs were siloed in various platforms, which made collaboration difficult and transparency low. As the QA landscape grew more complex, **Romiel Melliza Computo** took the initiative to build a system that bridges these gaps by leveraging **Google Sheets, GitLab/GitHub APIs, and automation tools**.

CDS started as a simple internal sprint tracker but evolved into a fully automated documentation and reporting ecosystem now used across multiple teams and sprints.
